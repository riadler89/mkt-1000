# SCAYLE Storefront Boilerplate - /middleware

The `middleware/` directory is designed for storing scripts that define middleware functions, which can execute code before rendering a page or group of pages either on the server or client-side. This directory is pivotal for implementing functionality such as authentication checks, redirect logic, data preprocessing, or logging activities before a user accesses a page. Middleware can be applied globally, to specific layouts, or to individual pages, offering a versatile way of controlling the application flow based on the request or the state of the application. This directory should contain JavaScript or TypeScript files that are structured to export a default function that receives the context object (providing access to route, store, etc.) and next middleware in the stack, allowing for sequential and conditional execution of business logic across the application.
