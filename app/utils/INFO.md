# SCAYLE Storefront Boilerplate - /utils

The `utils/` directory is to organize and store utility functions and helper scripts that are not directly tied to the Vue components but are crucial across various parts of the application. This directory is ideal for code that performs common tasks, such as date formatting, string manipulation, complex calculations, or API data fetching functions. By centralizing these utilities in one directory, developers can maintain cleaner code, promote reusability, and improve the maintainability of their projects. Files within this directory typically export functions or constants that can be easily imported and used wherever necessary within the application, ensuring that core functionalities are modular and easily accessible throughout the project.
