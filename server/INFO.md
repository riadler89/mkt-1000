# SCAYLE Storefront Boilerplate - /server

The `server/` directory is a dedicated space for placing server-side code and functionality that enhances or customizes the server-side behavior of a Nuxt application. This directory is typically used to define server middleware, API routes, and server handlers that are integral to server-side rendering and API strategies. The contents of this directory are automatically integrated into the Nuxt server, making it straightforward to add custom server logic, handle API requests directly, and perform server-side operations like authentication, data processing, and routing adjustments. This structure is particularly beneficial for applications that require a tight integration between client-side and server-side logic, enabling developers to maintain a unified codebase that leverages Nuxtâ€™s universal rendering capabilities.
