# @scayle/storefront-application-nuxt (RC)

Changelogs of past Release Candidates (prior to v1.0.0) of the SCAYLE Storefront Application.

## 1.0.0-rc.10

### üî• Highlights

#### üì° HTTP Request tracing with OpenTelemetry

The Storefront Boilerplate now includes a built-in integration with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
To enable the feature, set the environment variable `OTEL_ENABLED` to `true`.
This will inject additional code into your application's entrypoint which will initialize the OpenTelemetry SDK.
Automatic instrumentations as well as instrumentations from `storefront-nuxt` will be captured and exported via the OTLP protocol.

Currently, Vercel and Node are the only supported platforms for the OpenTelemetry integration.
Setting `OTEL_ENABLED` to `true` when building for other platforms will have no effect.

You should also set the runtime variable `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` to configure the service name used in traces. e.g. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=storefront-boilerplate`
Note: this variable is used directly by the OpenTelemetry libraries and is not available in the Nuxt `runtimeConfiguration`.

#### üõçÔ∏è Improved UX / UI for Promotions

We've redesigned the promotion badges displayed on the Product Listing Page, the Wishlist, and the Basket page.
The Badge text originates from Storefront APIs `customData`, with `headlineParts` in bold and `badgeLabel` in regular font.
We now implement ellipsis for long `badgeLabel` texts.

Please Note: Due to space constraints, the basket page shows only `badgeLabel`; if it is missing, it will fallback to `headlineParts`.

We have also improved the user experience on the Product Detail page with free gift options.
When the condition of a product, that has a free gift option configured, are met,
a free gift option will be displayed on the page with a grayed-out overlay.
Once conditions are met, a free gift option will be enabled and the user can add a free gift product to the cart.

#### üîç Improved linting setup with ESLint v9

The Storefront Boilerplate now includes an improved linting setup.
Relying on the new [ESLint 9](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-v9.0.0-released/) and [`@nuxt/eslint` module](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/module) to provide more project-aware linting.
To make configuration more easier the ESLint config has been updated to the new [flat config format](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/new-config-system-part-2/), allowing for simpler customization and overriding of rules.
Additionally the default Storefront ESLint config `@scayle/eslint-config-storefront` v4 is now using a subset of opinionated rules of [`@antfu/eslint-config`](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config).

### üíÖ Minor Changes

- Added subscription cancellation page to the subscription module
- New Price adoptions for basket page for promotions
- Increased eslint `no-composable-after-await` rule error level and fix the issues
- Fix caching for domain-based setups where we now consider the host for the SSR cache key.

  Additionally, we now set an `integrity` value that invalidates the SSR cache automatically when a new build is deployed.
  You can control the value through the `VERSION` environment variable, which should be set to your current Git short commit sha.

  Either you can set this normally during your build process

  ```sh
  VERSION=147f33d yarn build
  ```

  or when using the docker image

  ```sh
  docker build --build-arg VERSION=${GIT_SHORT_COMMIT_SHA} -f docker/node/Dockerfile .
  ```

### ü©π Patch Changes

- Removed an unnecessary CSS property which caused a visual bug on basket page
- Resolved a bug that affected the fetching of `combineWith` products
- Resolved the issue where the welcome login tab was displayed instead of the registration tab upon clicking the register link.
- Implemented a new utility function to format addresses dynamically. The function adjusts the address format according to the countryCode

## 1.0.0-rc.9

### üî• Highlights

#### üìñ Introducing Contentful as new CMS Provider for StorefrontCMS

We've added a Contentful integration as alternative to using Storyblok as CMS provider. This allows you to fetch data from Contentful and use it in your SFB.
To use this feature, you need to provide your Contentful space ID and access token in the `.env` file. You can find these values in your Contentful account settings.

```sh
NUXT_PUBLIC_CMS_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
NUXT_PUBLIC_CMS_SPACE=your-space-id
```

Once you have added these values, you can use Contentful by selecting the `contentful` option in the `cms.provider` field of the `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  cms: {
    provider: 'contentful',
  },
  // ...
})
```

Now you have access to `useCMS` composables and fetch data from Contentful in your SFB. `useCMS` accepts a string as an argument that will be used for caching purposes and returns a `fetchBySlug` function that you can use to fetch data by slug. `fetchBySlug` is a wrapper around Nuxt's `useAsyncData` and accepts a generic type that you can use to define the shape of the data you are fetching. Here is and example of how you can use this feature:

```ts
import type { TypeListingPageSkeleton } from '~~/modules/cms/providers/contentful/types/contentful-defs'

const props = defineProps<{
  selectedCategory: number | undefined
}>()

const route = useRoute()

if (!props.selectedCategory) {
  console.log('No category selected')
}
const { fetchBySlug } = useCMS(`ListingPage-${route.path}`)

const { data } = await fetchBySlug<TypeListingPageSkeleton>(
  `categories/${props.selectedCategory}`,
)
```

#### üîé Introducing Search Engine v2

We've implemented and replaced the whole search flow based on the new `Search Engine v2`.
This includes:

- Overall UI and UX adaptations (header search input, suggestions dropdown, applicable filter indicator, search within mobile sidebar, etc.)
- Category suggestions that can have filters applied
- Product suggestions that are resolved only by entering the exact ID
- Refined flow when resolving the search term
- Search page usage only as a fallback

#### Added Subscription Addon

We've implemented the Subscription Addons as a local module.
The subscription feature enables customers to subscribe to a specific variant of a product, which is then delivered at regular intervals on a chosen day.
This convenience allows customers to make regular purchases effortlessly.

### üöÄ Major Changes

- Fixed an issue where an empty IDP component was shown when no IDPs are enabled.
  The `useIDP` composable now returns an empty object when the IDP integration is not enabled.
  Ensure that the user is redirected to CO when entering the sign-in page with a `redirectUrl` parameter.
  This is now possible with the `@scayle/storefront-nuxt@{version}`.
  We refactored the IDP callback to have its own page to ensure we only call the IDP login RPC once.
- Improved Storyblok integration through SCAYLE Panel Add-on and plugin
- Disabled caching for Vercel Deployments
  Vercel's CDN Caching works slightly differently from the default Nuxt Page caching, which is currently incompatible with our Session handling.
  To disable all caching for Vercel Deployments, remove any `routeRules` you have configured in your `nuxt.config.ts`.
- Added ability to scroll to anchor links on the same page.
  The `Paragraph` component now supports an `anchor` prop that will be used to create an anchor target for that paragraph.
  If you have a Table of Contents and want to link to a specific paragraph, you can use the create links function on any text in your Content to create a link to it. When the user clicks on the link, he will scroll to the paragraph on the page.
  We also introduced a new component, `NestedParagraph,` that allows adding nested paragraphs, for example, for ordered lists.

### üíÖ Minor Changes

- Tweaked account index page to be visually consistent with other account page layouts
- Introduced a new feature for logging both build and runtime configurations
  Configuration logging can now be toggled on or off using the `ENABLE_CONFIG_LOG_BUILD` and `ENABLE_CONFIG_LOG_RUNTIME` environment variables.
- Added `@scayle/eslint-plugin-vue-composable`
  This plugin includes three rules `@scayle/vue-composable/no-composable-after-await`, `@scayle/vue-composable/no-lifecycle-after-await`, `@scayle/vue-composable/no-watch-after-await` which catch common errors in composables. You can read more about the plugin [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scayle/eslint-plugin-vue-composable).
- Improved user experience of time box element within Promotion Banner.
  Adds a clear understanding of the time left for the promotion to end by providing indicators of the time unit in the time box element for countdowns.
  The format of the time box element is changed to be more user-friendly with `(D : H : M)` format, or `(H : M : S)` format if the promotion lasts less than `24H`.

### Patch Changes

- Modified paddings of PromotionHurryToSaveBanners to have visual consistency with PromotionItemContent

- Adds missing Promotion Banner Link to Promotion Category on mobile view
- Removed dummy non-functional shipment detail link from OrderStatusBar

## 1.0.0-rc.07

This release focuses on stabilization and modularization, to improve the technical foundation and developer experience.

### üî• Highlights

#### ‚ú® Update to Nuxt 3.10.2 and Vue 3.4.19

Storefront Boilerplate now runs on both the latest Nuxt `v3.10.2` and Vue `v3.4.19` and benefits from a multitude of improvements.
To get more details about all the changes see the [Official Nuxt 3.10 Announcement Blog](https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-10)
and the [Official Vue 3.4.19 Changelogs](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#3419-2024-02-13).

#### üß™ Modularization: Extracting Cypress into dedicated sub-package

The Cypress testing solution has been extracted into a dedicated child package located at `cypress/`. This decouples the Dependencies from the main Storefront Application. To install all relevant Cypress Dependencies, execute `yarn install` within the `cypress/` directory.
By default the current Cypress integration does not rely anymore on the commercial Cypress Dashboard integration.
Please check the dedicated Readme file located at `cypress/README.md` for more details.

The following Dependencies have moved from `package.json` to `cypress/package.json`:

- `cypress`
- `cypress-real-events`
- `eslint-plugin-cypress`

#### üß± Modularization: Extracting Storyblok Integration into local module

The Storyblok integration has been extracted into a dedicated local Nuxt module `storefront-cms`.
This allows to combine all CMS provider relevant functionalities within a central Nuxt module and allows for simple future inclusion of additional CMS providers.

The new local Nuxt module can be found under `modules/cms/` and its path has been added to `nuxt.config.ts` to the `modules` list.

## 1.0.0-rc.06

This release focuses on stabilization and refactoring, to improve the technical foundation and developer experience.

### üöÄ Major Changes

- **BREAKING:** Nested public Storefront-specific `runtimeConfig` properties under the `storefront` key
  - Replaced `useRuntimeConfig().public.log` and `useRuntimeConfig().public.auth`
    with `useRuntimeConfig().public.storefront.log` and `useRuntimeConfig().public.storefront.log`
  - Changed `(...storefrontRuntimeConfigPublic as any),` to `storefront: storefrontRuntimeConfigPublic as any,` in `nuxt.config.ts`
- **BREAKING**: Allow the session of an `RpcContext` to be `undefined`
  - This changes the structure of the `RpcContext`, so it may be a breaking change if you have written custom RPC methods.
    The affected properties on the `RpcContext` are `sessionId`, `wishlistKey` and `basketKey` and
    the affected methods are `destroySession`, `createUserBoundSession`, `updateUser`, and `updateTokens`.
    If you use these methods or properties in a custom RPC method, make sure that you handle the case where they might be undefined.
    TypeScript will also catch these cases if you have `strictNullChecks` enabled.
    You can check `context.sessionId` (or another session-dependent property) to determine if the session is present.
    If one of these properties is present, all will be. Alternatively, you can call `assertSession(context)`
    before referencing any properties on the context. If the session is not present,
    an error will be thrown. For any usage of `context` after `assertSession` is called,
    TypeScript will understand that the session properties are present.

### üíÖ Minor Changes

- Extracted sorting and grouping basket helpers to `utils`
- Properly resolve `basketGroup` RPC with params
- Removed wishlist utils and moved them to the `useWishlistActions` composable
- Replaced `validation` plugin with `useValidationRules` composable

- Replaces `tracking` plugin with `useTracking` composable
- Renamed `divideWithHundred` price utility to `divideByHundred`
- Renamed `localeFormattedDate` date utility to `formatLocaleDate`
- Enforced using tracking sub-composables through the `useTrackingEvents` by turning off auto-import for sub-composables
- Simplified `Countdown` component logic by using `useIntervalFn` from `vueuse`
- Changed `radash` utils prefix to be underscore (`_`) instead of `use`, to avoid confusion between `radash`
  utilities and Vue composables. Resulting in e.g. `useSleep` to become `_sleep`.
- Used radash `_sort` (`useSort`) instead of native `sort` to avoid side effects
- Export composables as named functions
- Refactored components to use `withDefaults` and type generics to define component properties
- Refactored product and navigation components to reduce complexity
- Refactored account area component to reduce complexity and improve UI experience
  - `components/account/AccountHeader.vue`
  - `components/account/AccountWrapper.vue`
  - `components/addOns/AddOnsSelector.vue`
  - `components/order/OrderHeader.vue`
  - `components/order/OrderItemCard.vue`

  - `components/order/OrderStatusBar.vue`
  - `pages/account/orders.vue`
  - `pages/account/user.vue`
  - `pages/account/orders/[id].vue`
- Refactored account area orders components to reduce complexity and improve UI experience
  - `components/account/AccountWrapper.vue`
  - `components/order/OrderHistoryItem.vue`
  - `components/order/OrderItems.vue`
  - `composables/useOrders.ts`
- Refactored used Tailwind classes across the Storefront Boilerplate to comply with used Tailwind version
- Tweaked Promotion Engine implementation and UI experience across the Storefront Boilerplate
- Tweaked Order Success Page (OSP) complexity and UI experience
- Renamed buildtime environment variable `NUXT_STOREFRONT_DOMAIN_DEFAULT` to `DOMAIN_DEFAULT`
- Renamed buildtime environment variable `NUXT_STOREFRONT_DOMAIN_PER_LOCALE` to `DOMAIN_PER_LOCALE`
- Renamed buildtime environment variable `DISABLE_SSR_CACHE` to `DISABLE_PAGE_CACHE`

### ü©π Patch Changes

- Refactored `_sizes` to be a `computed` property in `components/product/ProductSizePicker.vue`
- Refactored `components/addOns/AddOnsSelector.vue` to use `computed` properties instead of `ref` and dedicated update functions
- Refactored `basketItems` to have an empty array as fallback in `components/basket/popover/BasketPopoverItems.vue`
- Added missing state key for `footerNavigationTrees` in `components/layout/footer/AppFooter.vue`
- Simplified watcher for `searchQuery` in `components/layout/headers/search/HederSearch.vue`
- Refactored Nuxt-specific imports to import from `#app` instead of `nuxt/app`

- Added `time` constants in `constants/time.ts` and used it in `components/ui/Countdown.vue`
- Refactored `PromotionBanner` to be displayed on `onNuxtReady` instead of `onServerPrefetch`
  to avoid missing interactivity during page load and hydration
- Removed `runtimeConfig.public.storyblok.webhookSecret` from `nuxt.config.ts`, as it is not supported by the `storyblok-nuxt` module
- Use `yn` to typecast potential build value of `runtimeConfig.public.gtm.debug` via `yn(process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_GTM_DEBUG)` in `nuxt.config.ts`
