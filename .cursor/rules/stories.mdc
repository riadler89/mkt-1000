- Create a new Storybook story for the given component using the `Meta` type to define metadata.
- Add a concise JSDoc comment directly above the `meta` definition. This should describe the story's purpose, usage, and any notable details.  
  **Do not** use `parameters.docs` or place JSDoc comments above story exports.
- Document each prop with JSDoc directly inside the `defineProps` block in the component (e.g., following the `SFButton` style).  
  **Do not** add JSDoc comments above the `args` in the story file.
- Organize the story under a clear Storybook category (e.g., `"Account"`).
- Only add story variants if they show meaningful visual or functional differences based on real-world use cases.  
  For example:
  - A `PromotionCard` with types like `"discount"`, `"bonus"`, or `"expired"` that display different layouts or visuals.
  - A `TabNavigation` with selected/unselected states showing different behaviors.
- **Do not** add variants that cannot be visually or functionally distinguished in Storybook (e.g., prop toggles that do not result in UI changes).
