# SCAYLE Storefront Boilerplate - /config

The `config/` directory is designated for organizing configuration files that govern various aspects of the application's behavior and environment settings. This directory typically contains modular configuration files that manage settings for different parts of the system, such as API keys, third-party service integrations, server-side functionality, and global application settings like locales or theme preferences. By structuring configuration files in this directory, developers can modularize their settings based on functionality or development environment (development, production, testing), making the application easier to configure and scale. This setup not only streamlines the management of environment-specific configurations through clear separation but also enhances security by isolating sensitive credentials from the main codebase, allowing for safer updates and maintenance.

Most of the contained configuration files are used within the root `nuxt.config.ts`.
