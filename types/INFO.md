# SCAYLE Storefront Boilerplate - /types

The `types/` directory intended to hold TypeScript type definitions and interfaces that are relevant to the application. This directory plays a crucial role in projects where TypeScript is used to ensure type safety and enhance code quality. Within this directory, developers can define custom types, interfaces, and enums that describe the shape of data structures, props, state, and other objects used throughout the application. By centralizing type definitions in the types/ directory, the project gains better organization, making it easier for developers to manage and reference types across different components and modules. This setup not only aids in maintaining a clean and scalable codebase but also leverages TypeScriptâ€™s capabilities to catch errors during development, thereby streamlining debugging and enhancing overall code robustness.
