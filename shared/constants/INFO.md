# SCAYLE Storefront Boilerplate - /constants

The `constants/` directory is strategically used for defining and centralizing constant values that are required across various parts of the application. This directory should contain files that export constants such as key value pairs for application settings, and any other immutable data that needs to be reused throughout the application. By organizing these constants in a dedicated directory, developers can ensure that these values are easily maintainable and accessible from anywhere in the project, reducing the likelihood of inconsistencies and facilitating easier updates. This practice not only helps in keeping the codebase clean and organized but also enhances the scalability and maintainability of the application by providing a single source of truth for all constant values used throughout the system.
