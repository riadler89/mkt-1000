# SCAYLE Storefront Boilerplate - /scripts

The `scripts/` directory, while not a standard directory in the default Nuxt 3 setup, is often utilized in projects to organize and store scripts that automate routine development tasks, such as custom build processes, data migration scripts, or automation tools for development environments. This directory is particularly useful for keeping non-application code that supports development operations, such as setup scripts, deployment scripts, or any server-related utilities that need to be executed outside of the regular Nuxt application lifecycle. By having these scripts in a dedicated directory, it allows developers to maintain a clear separation of concerns within the project structure, ensuring that these utilities are easily accessible and manageable without cluttering the core application directories. This approach helps streamline project maintenance and enhances the automation of repetitive tasks, thereby increasing development efficiency.
